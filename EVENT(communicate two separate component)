			@@@@	EVENT	@@@@
				------------
			@@@@ COMMUNICATION BETWEEN TWO SEPTATE COMPONENT @@@@
				---------------------------------------------

 (##)   difference between attributes and events = difference between wired circuits and wireless circuits.

 
 (##) There are two principal ways to interact with another component. 

		1. setting attributes on the component’s tag. A component’s public attributes constitute one part of its API.

		2. 	The second way to interact with a component is through EVENT. 
			(*) Like attributes, components declare the events they send out, and the events they can handle. Like attributes. 
			    public events part of the component’s public API(events are different from attributes)
			
			(*)   Components don’t send events to another component dirictly.
				 Components broadcast events of a particular type. If there’s a component that responds to that type of event, and if that component “hears” your event, then it will act on it.

@@@@@@  STEPS:

DEFINING AN EVENT:
					event name = updateExpense
				EX 1:   
						<aura:event type="COMPONENT">// There are two types of events Component and Application. 
							<aura:attribute name="expense" type="Expense__c"/>
						</aura:event>


```` STEP 2:  Register your component to send these events:
							(#) Register your component to send this events and specify custom event type
								NOTE:  custom event type specify which handlers can handel this event
								
							//Register right below its attribute definitions.
								
							EX1: name should be same as event name = updateExpense
							<aura:registerEvent name="updateExpense" type="c:expensesItemUpdate"/> 
`
`
`
````STEP 3: 	USE AN EVENT in a Component controllwe AND FIRE IT:--
			
				({
					clickReimbursed: function(component, event, helper) {
						var expense = component.get("v.expense");
						var updateEvent = component.getEvent("updateExpense");
						updateEvent.setParams({ "expense": expense });
						updateEvent.fire();
					}
`
`
`
```` STEP 4:    CREATING EVENT HANDLERS:
					
				EX1:
				<aura:handler name="updateExpense" event="c:expensesItemUpdate" action="{!c.handleUpdateExpense}"/> 
																																				event = EVENT TYPE
							
				HANDLER:-
						handleUpdateExpense: function(component, event, helper) {
							var updatedExp = event.getParam("expense");//ATTRIBUTE
							helper.updateExpense(component, updatedExp);
						}
